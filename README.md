### Hi there 👋

I'm Jiayu Liu, currently leading the tech team in a _Top 50 Generative AI Startup_, where we build a world-class platform enabling artists to produce and publish manga and comics. We are looking for machine learning engineers and researches with a passion for diffusion models and LLMs.

Previously I was the head of platform engineering in [Airbnb China](https://www.airbnb.cn/), where my day job is tech management. I also maintain a personal website at https://www.jiayu.me/.

Besides work, my current interests include:
- 🤖️ good old machine learning and AI (I used to do Kaggle but not any more) 
- 🔢 data and analytics infra (I used to do a start-up, also I'm a contributor to Apache [Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift), [Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs), and [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion))
- 🚗 autonomous driving :-)
